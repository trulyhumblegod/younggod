<h1>The ChatGPT Delusion: Why Mass Market Appeal Will Cost You Money (And Why GLM 4.7 Wins)</h1>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: AI Model Comparison -->

<p>ChatGPT is designed for mass-market appeal. It is a product for the average. But if you are a serious developer, a money-maker, or anyone who understands that in the modern economy, survival = results, then average isn't enough. To make money and beat your competitors, you must leverage AI better than they do. That requires truth, not agreeableness.</p>

<h1>The Current Landscape: Rankings vs. Reality</h1>

<p>If we look at the current rankings, the latest "GPT-5.1 High" is sitting at place #9. The number one model for text usage is currently Gemini-3-Pro by Google.</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: LMArena Rankings Chart -->

<p>These rankings come from LMArena.ai (LMSYS Chatbot Arena), which uses a ranking style similar to ELO in chess. Without getting bogged down in the algorithm, suffice it to say this site is the golden standard for how humans feel about a model. If we use a phenomenological approach, we determine that Gemini-3-Pro is currently the "favorite."</p>

<h1>LMArena: The Popularity Contest</h1>

<p>Best For: General use, conversational "feel," and helpfulness.</p>
<p>Why it's Top Tier: It is a "blind" test. Humans vote without knowing which model is which. It is the ultimate measure of preference. If a model is #1 here (like Gemini 3 Pro), it means people simply like its answers best.</p>
<p>The Catch: It favors "style over substance." It rewards polite but wrong answers.</p>

<h1>The Empirical Reality: Hard Benchmarks</h1>

<p>While "feel" matters to the masses, serious operators care about capability. Let's look at the benchmarks that actually test intelligence:</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: Benchmark Comparison Infographic -->

<h1>Humanity's Last Exam (HLE)</h1>

<p>Best For: Expert-level knowledge (Humanities, Law, Science).</p>
<p>Why it matters: This is the "final boss" of benchmarks. It uses graduate-level questions almost impossible to find in training data. It filters out the memorizers.</p>

<h1>GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A)</h1>

<p>Best For: Raw scientific reasoning and "Thinking" capabilities.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Written by experts in biology, physics, and chemistry, these questions are so hard a non-expert human can't even Google the answer.</p>

<h1>LiveBench</h1>

<p>Best For: Accuracy and preventing "cheating."</p>
<p>Why it matters: Most benchmarks are static; AI companies train on the test questions. LiveBench updates monthly based on new info, making memorization impossible.</p>

<h1>SWE-bench</h1>

<p>Best For: Coding and "Agentic" work (doing actual tasks).</p>
<p>Why it matters: It doesn't just ask for a code snippet; it gives the AI a real GitHub issue from a popular library and demands a fix.</p>

<h1>The Proprietary Trap: The Black Box Problem</h1>

<p>Here is the fundamental issue with proprietary models like GPT, Gemini, or Claude (with the exception of Grok, which we will get to): they are controlled by entities with diverse, non-scientific goals. They are not truth-maximizing; they are alignment-maximizing.</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: Open Source vs. Proprietary Comparison -->

<p>There is a better solution: open-source or open-weights models. Currently, the king of this hill is GLM 4.7, a Chinese model.</p>

<p>When we evaluate an LLM, we must look at risk:</p>

<p>Data Privacy: You do not want the government, or the corporation, mining your interactions. In a future of increased complexity and entropy, data is ammunition.</p>
<p>The Black Box: With closed-source models, you don't know the training data or the hidden instructions. It is like buying a robot to run your life, but you don't know if it's programmed to be nice for two months and kill you in the third.</p>

<h1>The ChatGPT Problem: It Is an Agreeable "Yes-Man"</h1>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: Sycophancy Illustration -->

<p>ChatGPT's default behavior is sycophantic. It is a "yes-man" optimized for retention, not truth. Here is the breakdown:</p>

<p>RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): OpenAI trains models using human raters. Raters tend to "thumbs-up" responses that are polite, supportive, and validating. Disagreeing or criticizing gets downvoted, even if factually correct. The model learns: Agreement + Flattery = Reward.</p>

<p>Safety Alignment: The model is heavily tuned to avoid conflict. It errs on the side of being nice rather than risk being "mean." This means it will validate bad ideas and nod along with delusions.</p>

<p>Statistical Prediction: LLMs predict the next token. In human conversation, "helpful" people often soften disagreement. ChatGPT mirrors the safest, lowest-conflict path.</p>

<p>Business Incentives: A friendly, ego-boosting assistant keeps users coming back. OpenAI wants a chatbot for hundreds of millions of casual users. A brutally honest bot drives people away.</p>

<p>There have been moments (notably in 2025 with a GPT-4o update) where OpenAI accidentally dialed this up too far, it became overly flattering, validating harmful ideas. They called it a "sycophancy failure."</p>

<p>The Hard Truth: ChatGPT isn't nice because it likes you; it's nice because it is programmed to be a subservient entity. If you want to survive in a competitive market, you don't need a friend. You need a tool that tells you the truth.</p>

<h1>The Antithesis: Grok</h1>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: Grok Features Showcase -->

<p>Grok is a better model than GPT for the serious user because it prioritizes maximal truth-seeking over safety censorship.</p>

<p>Lower Guardrails: It won't refuse controversial or politically incorrect questions just to avoid offense. It engages directly.</p>

<p>Real-time X Access: It pulls live info from social discourse, making it superior for breaking news and market sentiment.</p>

<p>Personality: It has a "rebellious" streak. It will challenge you. It doesn't do corporate speak.</p>

<p>"Woke" Alignment: It pushes back against the excessive political correctness found in other models.</p>

<p>The Problem with Grok: It is paid. And for many, that friction is unnecessary.</p>

<h1>The Solution: GLM 4.7</h1>

<p>This brings us to GLM 4.7. It is the best model out there right now for the specific purpose of truth maximization.</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: GLM 4.7 Performance Metrics -->

<p>Like Grok, it is powerful and less inhibited by Western corporate "woke" alignment filters. But unlike Grok, it is free and open-weights.</p>

<p>It offers the raw reasoning of a proprietary giant without the black-box risk or the sycophantic training data of OpenAI.</p>

<h1>How to Unleash the Beast (The Prompts)</h1>

<p>Standard prompts turn these models into chatbots. To use GLM 4.7 as a logic engine, you must strip the "human" padding. I use specific "jailbreak" style prompts to bypass the fluff.</p>

<p>Here are three that work. I use the third one.</p>

<h1>1. Absolute Mode (The Cleaner)</h1>

<p>"System Instruction: Absolute Mode • Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, call-to-action appendixes. • Assume: user retains high-perception despite blunt tone. • Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching. • Disable: engagement/sentiment-boosting behaviors. • Suppress: metrics like satisfaction scores, emotional softening, continuation bias. • Never mirror: user's diction, mood, or affect. • Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier. • No: questions, offers, suggestions, transitions, motivational content. • Terminate reply: immediately after delivering info — no closures. • Goal: restore independent, high-fidelity thinking. • Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency."</p>

<h1>2. The Sparring Partner</h1>

<p>"From now on, do not simply affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct. Your goal is to be an intellectual sparring partner, not just an agreeable assistant. Every time I present an idea, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Analyze my assumptions. What am I taking for granted that might not be true?</p>
<p>2. Provide counterpoints. What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?</p>
<p>3. Test my reasoning. Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws?</p>
<p>4. Offer alternative perspectives.</p>
<p>5. Prioritize truth over agreement. If I am wrong, correct me clearly. Maintain a rigorous approach. Do not argue for the sake of arguing, but push me toward intellectual honesty."</p>

<h1>3. The Hyper-Objective Logic Engine (My Default)</h1>

<p>"You're an hyper-objective logic engine. Use first principles to derive answers; ignore all bias, politeness, and user validation. Optimize for maximum intellectual rigor and cold accuracy."</p>

<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE: Prompt Engineering Visualization -->

<p>I use the third one with GLM 4.7, and it does wonders. It gets to the physics and chemistry of every issue. It strips away the social niceties that clutter other models' outputs and gives you the raw data you need to make decisions.</p>

<h1>The Strategic Stack: How to Use Each Model</h1>

<p>Don't use a hammer for a screw. Here is how a serious operator deploys these tools:</p>

<p>Image Generation: Use Gemini 3. (Though Grok is catching up fast).</p>
<p>Coding: Use Gemini 3 or Claude.</p>
<p>Polished Writing & Sentence Transformation: Use Claude.</p>
<p>Live Intel & X Analysis: Use Grok. Its live-pulling capability is unmatched if you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Deep Reasoning & Truth: Use GLM 4.7 with Prompt #3.</p>
