<h1>Organic Architectures and Sacred Geometry</h1>
<p>Nature does not build in straight lines. Everything from the branching of trees to the neural pathways in our brains
    follows a recursive logic—a sacred geometry that optimizes for flow and energy.</p>
<p>When we design our cities and our software, we often forget this. We build boxes. But the future of technology is
    organic. It is self-healing, adaptive, and inherently beautiful.</p>
<p>The secrets of life are written in the patterns of growth. By mimicking these patterns, we can create systems that
    feel less like tools and more like extensions of our own biological identity.</p>
